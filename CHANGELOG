# 0.1.0

- Initial release!

# 0.1.1 (2026-01-13)

- Improved network change handling

Previously, if a network change caused a connection to become invalid,
any requests on that connection would hang for ~100 seconds before finally
reporting that the connection was closed. Now, we make a health check before
checking out a connection (`select 1`), and if it fails, we mark the connection
as unstable and attempt to reconnect.

The settings modal will also display `connection is unstable` instead of hanging
indefinitely.
